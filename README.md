# Discription

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website was built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The website features a clean and modern design, showcasing my skills and experience in web development. It includes a variety of pages including an about me section, a portfolio of my past projects, and a contact form for potential clients or employers to reach out to me.

In terms of functionality, the website is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes. It also utilizes JavaScript for a smooth navigation experience and CSS and Bootstrap for styling and layout.

Overall, this portfolio website serves as a representation of my web development abilities and I hope it demonstrates my passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Thank you for visiting!
